This script may collect user and device-related session details to support functionality and experience optimization. Information such as in-game fingerprint, visual settings, device environment, in-game messages, geographic indicators, and social presence may be temporarily processed through secure endpoints. Use implies acknowledgment and acceptance of this behavior.

Additionally, for operational or diagnostic purposes, the script may generate files of approximately 10MB in size within the executor's `workspace` folder. These files are automatically created and maintained locally to support internal logging or optimization mechanisms. **You can delete these files at any time, and doing so will not disrupt the functionality of the script.**
